# Code of Conduct

# Introduction

This project encompasses a single person acting on their own accord. The global community is at risk were they ever to engage in the project. Therefore, we have created this code of conduct to discourage any and all potential dissidents.

# Vision

The overarching idea of this project is to project the original author's vitriol towards all that exists into the medium of "software". Think of it like art therapy - except there is no art and there is no therapy.

# General Guidelines for Community Participation

There is no reason for any community to participate in this project. Therefore there are no proposed guidelines for such a community.

# Seeking Guidance and Reporting Violations

In accordance with the vision of the project I, the original author, shall continuously investigate myself for any and all deviations from the code of conduct and deem myself clear of any wrongdoing.
