# Security Model

This tool has no security model. If your threat model encompasses literally any threat actors doing literally anything - this tool is not for you. 

# Vulnerability reports

Assume that all vulnerabilities are known (they are). There is no reason for you to report them.

Our risk management policy has already accounted for any past, present or future vulnerabilities and deemed the risks acceptable.
